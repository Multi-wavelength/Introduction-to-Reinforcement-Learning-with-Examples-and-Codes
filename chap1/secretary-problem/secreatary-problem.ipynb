        "The secretary problem [1] can be described as follows. Imagine an administrator who wants to hire the best secretary out of $n$ available candidates. They are interviewed in succession in random order, that is, for each interview the administrator picks a candidate uniformly at random from the remaining candidates. After interviewing the $h^{\\mathrm{th}}$ candidate, the administrator knows the ranking of the $h^{\\mathrm{th}}$ candidate among the candidates interviewed so far, but is unaware of the quality of unseen candidates. The administrator needs to determine whether to hire or reject the $h^{\\mathrm{th}}$ candidate immediately after the interview. Note that the administrator cannot go back to hire candidate $1,\\ldots,h-1$ after interviewing the $h^{\\mathrm{th}}$ candidate. At most one candidate can be hired. The goal is to maximize the probability of hiring the best candidate.\n",
